# Regatta

A web-based multiplayer recreation of the 1970 3M board game "Regatta" — a sailboat racing game featuring wind mechanics, tactical positioning, and right-of-way rules.

## About

This is a learning project focused on building a real-world application with Python. The game will support 2-6 players racing yachts around a configurable course, with wind affecting movement speed and strategy.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.13, FastAPI, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React 19
- **Real-time:** WebSockets

## Status

🚧 In development

## Game Rules

Based on the original 1970 3M Regatta board game. See `regatta_game_rules.pdf` for the complete ruleset.

Key mechanics:
- Wind direction affects movement speed (broad reach fastest, beating slowest)
- Spinnaker cards boost downwind speed
- Puff cards provide tactical advantages
- Blanketing opponents blocks their wind
